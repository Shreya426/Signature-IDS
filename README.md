Intrusion Detection System using XGBoost on UNSW-NB15

This project implements a signature-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the XGBoost algorithm. It is designed to detect and classify multiple types of known network attacks based on labeled data from the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

Project Summary

- Type: Signature-Based Detection (Supervised Learning)
- Algorithm: XGBoost (multi-class classification)
- Dataset: UNSW-NB15 (real-world labeled network traffic)
- Model Accuracy: 99.50%
- Precision: 98.91%
- Recall: 98.56%
- F1 Score: 98.73%

Whatâ€™s Included

- preprocessing.py: Full code for preprocessing and encoding the dataset.
- training_xgboost.txt: A placeholder note explaining how to request access to the full training and evaluation script.
- sample_outputs/: Folder for visuals such as confusion matrix or charts.

Private Components

To maintain project integrity and avoid misuse, only 25% of the code is made public. The full training, evaluation, and prediction logic is not included in this repository.
